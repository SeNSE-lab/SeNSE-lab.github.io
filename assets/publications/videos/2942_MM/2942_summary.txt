This mp4 file includes video recordings of the experimental tests including trials from the compliant and slipping tests. Additionally, the video shows data from the camera sensor during rotation and axial deflection tests. The arrows (10 x) superimposed on the tracked points, showing the points motion from the initial frame, provide a dynamic visualization of the sensing methodology.
