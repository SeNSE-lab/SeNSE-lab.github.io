  abstract = {{Rats use active, rhythmic movements of their whiskers to acquire
	tactile information about three-dimensional object features. There
	are no receptors along the length of the whisker; therefore all tactile
	information must be mechanically transduced back to receptors at
	the whisker base. This raises the question: how might the rat determine
	the radial contact position of an object along the whisker? We developed
	two complementary biomechanical models that show that the rat could
	determine radial object distance by monitoring the rate of change
	of moment ( or equivalently, the rate of change of curvature) at
	the whisker base. The first model is used to explore the effects
	of taper and inherent whisker curvature on whisker deformation and
	used to predict the shapes of real rat whiskers during deflections
	at different radial distances. Predicted shapes closely matched experimental
	measurements. The second model describes the relationship between
	radial object distance and the rate of change of moment at the base
	of a tapered, inherently curved whisker. Together, these models can
	account for recent recordings showing that some trigeminal ganglion
	(Vg) neurons encode closer radial distances with increased firing
	rates. The models also suggest that four and only four physical variables
	at the whisker base - angular position, angular velocity, moment,
	and rate of change of moment - are needed to describe the dynamic
	state of a whisker. We interpret these results in the context of
	our evolving hypothesis that neural responses in Vg can be represented
	using a state-encoding scheme that includes combinations of these
	four variables.}},

	images from multiple video cameras and a Macintosh computer display
	to facilitate manipulation of data generated during our neurophysiological

	extracting quantitative data from the videotape for further analysis.
	Three applications are presented: (A) we used an analog video mixer
	to synchronize neurophysiological recordings with ongoing behaviors
	of freely moving rats; (B) we used a chroma keyed digital overlay
	to generate positional data for the rat's face during drinking behavior;
	and (C) we combined a computer model of a rat's head and whiskers
	with videos of exploratory behaviors to better track and quantify
	movements in three dimensions. Although the applications described

	behaviors, including grooming, eating, and free tactile exploration.
	Multiunit responses in the 1000- 4500 Hz range were found to be strongly
	correlated with tactile stimulation of lip and whisker (perioral)
	regions. These responses occurred regardless of whether the stimulus
	was externally or self-generated and during both active and passive
	touch. In contrast, perioral movements that did not tactually stimulate
	this region of the face (e. g., chewing) produced no detectable increases
	in GCL activity. In addition, GCL responses were not correlated with
	movement extremes. When rats used their lips actively for palpation
	and exploration, the tactile responses in the GCL were not detectably
	modulated by ongoing jaw movements. However, active palpation and
	exploratory behaviors did result in the largest and most continuous
	bursts of GCL activity: responses were on average 10\% larger and
	50\% longer during palpation and exploration than during grooming
	or passive stimulation. Although activity levels differed between
	behaviors, the position and spatial extent of the peripheral receptive
	field was similar over all behaviors that resulted in tactile input.
	Overall, our data suggest that the 1000- 4500 Hz multiunit responses
	in the Crus IIa GCL of awake rats are correlated with tactile input

	more than isolated whiskers. The time course of damping varied depending
	on the individual whisker and the phase of the whisking cycle, which
	suggests that the rat may modulate biomechanical parameters that

	and exploration-are found to fall to one extreme of the spectrum,
	and exploratory movements in particular are shown to possess characteristics
	that clearly distinguish them from other varieties of movement. Specifically,
	the exploratory process must permit animals to extract an object's
	features independently of the sequence of movements executed to explore
	the object. Based in part on our work on the rat vibrissal system,
	we suggest that exploration of objects may consist of two complementary
	levels of sensorimotor prediction operating in parallel. At the cognitive
	level, the animal might move so as to perform hypothesis testing
	about the identity or nature of the object. The particular hypothesis
	tests chosen by the animal might be implemented through sequences
	of control-level predictions that could be generated at the level
	of the brainstem and cerebellum.}},

	used to study sensorimotor integration. Recent work has suggested
	that during object contact, the forces and moments at the whisker
	base may serve as important perceptual cues to the rat. To date,
	however, the force/moment profile that results from a whisker sweeping
	against an object has yet to be characterized, because it requires
	the simultaneous measurement of two-dimensional forces on the order
	of millinewtons. Current technology for these measurements typically

	two-dimensional force sensor with +/- 0.02 mN resolution; it is extremely
	compact, has a highly linear static response with low-noise output,
	and is inexpensive to build. We demonstrate the advantages and limitations
	of the sensor in three different experimental protocols, ranging
	from the precise quantification of forces on isolated (plucked) whiskers,
	to the detection of whisker-contact times in the awake behaving animal.
	Given the high fidelity of the sensor, it could have utility in a

	estimate radial object distance, that is, the distance from the base

	cannot be directly measured, however, because there are no mechanoreceptors
	along the vibrissa. Instead, the mechanical signals generated by
	the vibrissa's interaction with the environment must be transmitted
	to mechanoreceptors near the vibrissa base. The first part of this
	paper surveys the different mechanical methods by which the rat could
	determine radial object distance. Two novel methods are highlighted:
	one based on measurement of bending moment and axial force at the
	vibrissa base, and a second based on measurement of how far the vibrissa
	rotates beyond initial contact. The second part of the paper discusses
	the application of Weber's law to two methods for radial distance

	extraction with artificial whiskers. Many of these studies have used
	an approach in which the whisker is rotated against the object through
	a small angle. Each small-angle ``tap{''} of the whisker provides
	information about the radial distance between the base of the whisker
	and the object. By tapping at various points on the object, a full
	representation of the surface can be gradually constructed in three-dimensional
	space. It is clear, however, that this tapping method does not exploit
	useful information about object contours that could be extracted
	by ``sweeping{''} the whisker against the object. Rotating the whisker
	against the object through a large angle permits the collection of
	a sequence of contact points as the whisker slips along the surface.
	The present paper derives an algorithm based on a numerical cantilever
	beam model of the whisker to measure object profile shape over a
	single large-angle whisker rotation using only information about
	torque and angle at the whisker base. The algorithm is validated
	experimentally using three different object shapes. As the method

	explore their environment. This ``whisking{''} behavior has generally
	been reported to be strictly synchronous and symmetric about the
	snout, and it is thought to be controlled by a brainstem central
	pattern generator. Because the vibrissae can move independently of
	the head, however, maintaining a stable perception of the world would
	seem to require that rats adjust the bilateral symmetry of whisker
	movements in response to head movements. The present study used high-speed
	videography to reveal dramatic bilateral asymmetries and asynchronies
	in free-air whisking during head rotations. Kinematic analysis suggested
	that these asymmetric movements did not serve to maintain any fixed
	temporal relationship between right and left arrays, but rather to
	redirect the whiskers to a different region of space. More specifically,
	spatial asymmetry was found to be strongly correlated with rotational
	head velocity, ensuring a ``look-ahead{''} distance of almost exactly
	one whisk. In contrast, bilateral asynchrony and velocity asymmetry
	were only weakly dependent on head velocity. Bilateral phase difference
	was found to be independent of the whisking frequency, suggesting
	the presence of two distinct left and right central pattern generators,
	connected as coupled oscillators. We suggest that the spatial asymmetries
	are analogous to the saccade that occurs during the initial portion
	of a combined head-eye gaze shift, and we begin to develop the rat
	vibrissal system as a new model for studying vestibular and proprioceptive
	contributions to the acquisition of sensory data.}},
